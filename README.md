# my-epic-notes

This is a from scratch remix app where I am copying over the Epic Notes project
from the [EPICWEB](https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops) Full Stack Foundations
workshop.

It allows me to make changes based on my own opinions, leave out anything that
is only required for the workshop app to work, and understand what needs to be
added and why, to make this app work.

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app
server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
